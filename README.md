# Cracking the Coding Interview

I've decided to purchase this great book once again, not really to help with coding interviews, but just for a little more practice and to brush up on some skills that have catching dust for a while. As a research engineer a lot of people don't believe that being 'fluent' in algorithms and data structures is important, but I find that even just thinking about it in the back of your head whilst working on various problems can be incredibly beneficial, and save a lot of time in the future by reducing the chance you'll have to go back and implement something using a different method later.

I'll be publishing my solutions to various answers here, written in Python.

## Why Python

When I studied at NUS, I read through the majority of this book and solved most of the problems in Java. Now, working in AI, I find that I am generally using Python, and so will use this repo to house the solutions to this book in Python as I go through the questions. I don't expect to tackle all of them (I simply don't have the time nor patience), but whenever I get the chance I'll add my solutions.

The benefit of Python over Java also is that it's a lot easier to read, and there are less quirks that you have to worry about, so reading solutions written in Python will give you a better idea behind the methodology and algorithms used to solve a specific problem. The downside is there are definitely some problems in the book which are simply made irrelevant, or much easier, by choosing Python. Oh well.

## The Book

This is an incredibly popular book, known by many in the computer science realm. My job isn't to advertise it. Besides, I've already ended up buying 3 copies as it's been too heavy to bring with my each time I've relocated to a new country, so I feel like I've done enough on that front ;) . But for reference sake, I am using the 6th edition of the book which can be found on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850). (no that's not a referral link T_T)
